  {
    "Term": "AI Agent",
    "Definition": "A computer program or system designed to perceive its environment, make decisions and take actions to achieve a specific goal or set of goals, operating autonomously without direct human control."
  },
  {
    "Term": "Bias",
    "Definition": "Has two meanings: (1) A systemic skew or prejudice in AI model output, reflecting inherent or learned prejudices in training data, manifesting as cultural, gender, racial, political, or socioeconomic biases. (2) A technical parameter in neural networks used alongside weights to influence node output and adjust output independently of inputs."
  },
  {
    "Term": "Chat Bot",
    "Definition": "A software application designed to simulate conversation with human users, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and sometimes machine learning to understand and respond to queries. Ranges from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated AI-driven bots."
  },
  {
    "Term": "Generative AI",
    "Definition": "Artificial intelligence systems that can generate new content (texts, images, audio, video) in response to user prompts after being trained on an earlier set of data."
  },
  {
    "Term": "Hallucinations",
    "Definition": "Incorrect or misleading results that AI models generate, caused by factors including insufficient training data, incorrect assumptions, or biases."
  },
  {
    "Term": "Large Language Model (LLM)",
    "Definition": "AI systems designed to understand, generate, and interact with human language on a large scale, trained on enormous datasets using deep learning techniques like transformer architectures."
  },
  {
    "Term": "Parameters",
    "Definition": "The internal variables of an AI model learned from training data, including weights and biases in neural networks, that define the model's behavior and determine how it processes input to produce output."
  },
  {
    "Term": "Prompt",
    "Definition": "The input given to an AI model to initiate or guide its generation process, acting as a directive or set of instructions that defines the nature, scope, and specificity of the AI's output."
  },
  {
    "Term": "Prompt Engineering",
    "Definition": "The practice of crafting and structuring input prompts to effectively guide AI models in producing specific and desired outputs, optimizing the relevance, accuracy, and quality of generated content."
  },
  {
    "Term": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)",
    "Definition": "A technique combining retrieval-based and generative models, where an AI system first retrieves information from a dataset or knowledge base, then uses this data to generate a response augmented with additional context."
  },
  {
    "Term": "Training Data",
    "Definition": "The process by which a machine learning model learns to perform a specific task by being exposed to a large training dataset and iteratively adjusting its internal parameters to minimize errors in output."
  },
  {
    "Term": "Tuning",
    "Definition": "The process of adjusting a pre-trained model to better suit a specific task or dataset by modifying the model's parameters, focusing on refining capabilities based on targeted data or specific performance objectives."

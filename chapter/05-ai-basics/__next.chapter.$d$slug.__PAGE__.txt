However, agentic AI otherwise faces the same limitations as GenAI, and because it is more powerful, when things go wrong it can also be more risky. Multiple models are interconnected through agentic AI, so an inaccurate output from one of them could feed into another model that processes it inaccurately, and so on, leading to a final response that is impacted by multiple stages of errors."}]

32:T497,GenAI powers intelligent assistants, such as chatbots for internal or external use, which can handle thousands of inquiries simultaneously, providing information and processing routine requests automatically. These systems can integrate with existing service channels, while potentially reducing wait times and freeing up staff for complex cases. The technology can support consistent service levels in some domain areas while scaling automatically to meet demand peaks, with the potential for improving satisfaction while reducing operational costs. Imagine you’re running a call center during the scheduled enrollment period for a public health insurance program. Normally, you’d need to bring in dozens of temporary staff to handle the flood of calls. GenAI is like having an infinitely scalable team of front-desk clerks who answer routine questions and process simple requests automatically. Agentic AI has the potential to build on these capabilities by developing more effective strategies to assist customers. For example, an AI agent may, after several attempts to solve a resident’s issue, proceed to contact a human support agent and assign them to the case.20:["$","div","div-4",{"className":"collapsible-wrapper-bullet","data-collapsible":"true","children":["\n  ",["$","div","div-0",{"className":"collapsible-header","data-target":"collapsible-tav32ogux","children":["\n    ",["$","svg","svg-0",{"className":"collapsible-icon","width":"20","height":"20","viewBox":"0 0 20 20","fill":"currentColor","children":["\n      ",["$","path","path-0",{"fillRule":"evenodd","d":"M7.293 14.707a1 1 0 010-1.414L10.586 10 7.293 6.707a1 1 0 011.414-1.414l4 4a1 1 0 010 1.414l-4 4a1 1 0 01-1.414 0z","clipRule":"evenodd"}],"\n    "]}],"\n    ",["$","strong","strong-0",{"children":"Supporting service delivery:"}],"\n  "]}],"\n  ",["$","div","div-1",{"className":"collapsible-content","id":"collapsible-tav32ogux","style":{"display":"none"},"children":["\n",["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$32"}],"\n  "]}],"\n"]}]

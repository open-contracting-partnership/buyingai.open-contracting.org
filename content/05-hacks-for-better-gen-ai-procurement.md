# Hacks for better GenAI procurement

## Or, tips for navigating complex procurements in imperfect situations

| Who: Procurement teams What: Practical strategies to get the most from GenAI procurements, including off-the-shelf purchases |

We know that not everyone lives in a world where great tech procurement feels possible. Maybe you have no institutional AI strategy, feel unable to buy technology using an agile approach, or have decentralized procurement that makes it hard to ensure the right people are in the room.

Here are some strategies for those of you seeking to still get the most out of your GenAI customize/build procurements, despite your constraints: 

* **Find your allies.** Look for people across your government from legal, IT, finance, and beyond who are good at getting things done, and willing to help you out. These allies can support you with your current procurement in the short term, and help with strengthening practices generally in the long term. You might also find inspiration in other cities, countries or agencies who have dealt with similar issues and might have ideas.   
* **Buy just what you need to get started.** This might look like just buying research and development, a “pilot,” or software development services, rather than buying a final product right away with a large scope, budget, and duration.   
* **Engage the market early before you buy.** There are many ways of letting potential vendors know that you are considering making a purchase. You can describe your plans publicly before you issue any RFPs so that they can get ready. If you are able, start with a RFI to gather market intelligence to inform your RFP.   
* **Make your solicitation agile-ish, even if you can’t be agile.** Go beyond technology specifications to describe the problem to be solved and intended outcomes, including as much detail as possible about your envisioned results. You can also articulate your needs in ways that agile developers are more likely to respond and succeed. For example, If your government blocks certain words or concepts, you can use alternatives. For example, instead of “sprints” you can ask for weekly milestones, “demos” can be milestone reviews, and “user research” can be a stakeholder needs assessment.      
* **Don’t be afraid to ask basic questions during selection.** Vendors should be able to tell you in plain language important information like what data they used to create their model, how they will use your government's data, and what success and failure looks like for their tool. You can also request access to the data that was used to train or fine-tune models. Together, this information can help you understand the model outputs and identify potential issues.   
* **Aim for shorter contracts (with smaller budgets).** AI technology is changing quickly, and what is the best solution now might be obsolete in five or ten years. Shorter contracts can help get the best technology to meet your government’s current needs, and manage risks.   
* **Make room for improvements (without change orders).** By incorporating guarantee periods or structuring flexibility into the contract, buyers can better adapt the scope or request changes if the results are not meeting expectations.   
* **Piggyback off existing contracts** to get services and features, this could be task orders, cooperative contracts or other pre-approved vendors.

## What if I’m just buying off-the-shelf GenAI?

The most common way that public sector organizations are procuring GenAI tools is through framework agreements or multiple awards. Although buying GenAI this way is more straightforward, it’s still important to pay attention to several topics that we cover throughout this guidance, including:  

* **Use case:** What you need should inform what you buy.   
* **Data governance and security:** You should understand how your government data will be used.   
* **Testing and experimentation:** Before rolling out organization-wide, consider pilots to help mitigate risks by creating time and space for learning what works and what does not.       
* **Engaging your user and the public when possible:** Input from your end user and the public along the procurement journey can be very helpful, especially if the tool will be public-facing, or help inform decision-making for service delivery.    

You can also be agile and innovative while working inside your pre-approved structures. For example, you can:

* **Use MAS/License as your foundation, not your final destination:** Don’t think “locked in” but see if your project team can build custom prompts, models, or applications using the enterprise-licensed GenAI as your foundation, such as via an API.  
* **Negotiate for a pilot within your framework agreement/MAS:** If this is possible, you could test different GenAI technologies before starting a full procurement.   
* **Use procurement to add new functions:** Consider if you might….   
  * Piggyback off existing contracts to get new features, such as through task orders.   
  * Partner with smaller, agile vendors that are already on the MAS. They might be able to work with you through existing contracts.  
  * Leverage cooperative agreements: Some schedules allow you to use solutions procured by other agencies.

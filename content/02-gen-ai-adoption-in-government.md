## GenAI adoption in government 

Responsible and effective use of GenAI in government isn’t just about buying the ‘right’ product. The public sector must have the internal capacity to use it well. This means that organizations must be equipped to: 

* Conduct their own risk assessments and impact evaluations  
* Define purpose-specific use cases and enable teams to experiment, iterate, and learn  
* Maintain human oversight, auditability, and accountability across the AI lifecycle

A lot of this work goes beyond the procurement function. For example, leadership is responsible for creating a clear vision and organizational strategy around AI to take advantage of this emerging technology while managing risks. Your project team needs to really understand the problem they are trying to solve, and think through change management to support adoption. Your technology team should be aware of technical implications. 

However, it’s still rare for governments to have all these capacities in place, and together as the field we are still building our understanding of AI and how to best use it. In this section, we provide an overview of how to help get your organization AI-ready, and the role of procurement in supporting AI-readiness. 

## What an AI-ready organization looks like 

There are several enabling conditions that can help you and organization get the most from your GenAI technology. The more of these capacities you have in place, the better you will be able to procure and adopt GenAI technology. It’s still feasible to buy GenAI without all of these conditions in place \- and many governments do\! \- but the tools are less likely to be used or used well, leading to wasted resources or potential harms to government services or data. 

If your government is not as AI-ready as you would like, we invite you to consider how you might support changing that using this guidance. This might look like advocating internally for creating an institutional AI adoption strategy, asking for permission to use a more agile procurement method, or suggesting that your team can use staff time to take a course and upskill on GenAI. 

### Institutional AI-readiness

Institutional AI-readiness is established at the leadership level, often by people that work across government agencies, such as the Department of Technology or Innovation. While procurement officials don't set this strategic direction, this strategy impacts the purchasing vehicles, vendor relationships, and contract structures that procurement can pursue: 

* **Create and use an institutional AI adoption strategy.** A robust AI adoption strategy includes your vision, priorities, governance and oversight mechanisms for implementing GenAI across government agencies in effective and responsible ways. It should address key risks, including technical, operational, ethical, and reputational considerations, as well as set out clear requirements for data privacy, transparency and accountability, security, bias monitoring, and regular risk assessments.   
    
  Different uses and technologies carry different levels of risk. Your institutional AI strategy should establish clear criteria for categorizing AI systems based on their potential impact and risk level. Your procurement approach should allow for quick access to low-risk use cases, and implement stricter requirements for high-risk AI systems, including enhanced documentation and human oversight.

### Departmental or project team AI-readiness

By this, we mean the department, program or agency that is buying GenAI technology as part of a project. The project team knows their needs best, and if and how GenAI can help them achieve better outcomes. Procurement should be consulted, but usually don’t lead in getting a project team AI-ready:

* **Build a strong understanding of the problem you are trying to solve.** This problem should drive the technology and purchasing decisions. GenAI might not be the right tool to meet your needs.   
* **Know your data.** Seek to understand your own data. Good quality data is important for good GenAI outputs.   
* **Understand your capacity to actively manage your vendor relationships as part of your project implementation.** Proactive contract management and close vendor collaboration are important for projects, especially those with technology deployments. GenAI tools require ongoing monitoring and performance assessment. By closely monitoring progress and maintaining open communication channels to address issues early, you can help ensure that your GenAI solution is working as intended.


| Help for project teams to get AI-ready  Lots of resources have been developed to help develop your project team’s approach to implementing GenAI in your project, including:  The UK government’s [AI playbook](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-playbook-for-the-uk-government/artificial-intelligence-playbook-for-the-uk-government-html) for agencies and project teams The U.S. General Service Administration’s [guidance](https://coe.gsa.gov/coe/ai-guide-for-government/identifying-ai-use-cases-in-your-organization/) for project teams to get AI ready 18F’s De-Risking Guide has [strategies for vendor management](https://guides.18f.org/derisking-government-tech/vendor-management/)  The Australian Government’s [AI ethics principles](https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/australias-artificial-intelligence-ethics-principles) to design responsible AI initiatives |

### Procurement AI-readiness

Procurement directors and procurement officials can do a lot to support the implementation of responsible and effective GenAI.

* **Understand what GenAI technology you can purchase already.** You likely can acquire GenAI tools through framework agreements, and/or preexisting centralized or decentralized contracts. For example, your project team might already have access to CoPilot if your government uses Microsoft Office, or Gemini through Google Workspace. This doesn’t mean you and the project team shouldn’t be thoughtful in how to use GenAI, but it means you might not go through a full procurement process.  
* **Embrace agile and innovative procurement approaches.** This might be one of the most important steps that you can support to ensure better deployment and outcomes from GenAI. Enable your project team to buy differently and use outcomes-based contracting, rather than rigid requirements, to promote creative solutions and maximize value. Starting small and opting for iteration when possible can help manage risks and achieve the best results for GenAI purchases, as well as open the door to engaging with smaller, innovative providers that don’t typically participate in public procurement. (Depending on your current policies and practices, we know this can be challenging. Check out our *Hacks for better GenAI procurement* section for ideas on how to be more agile and iterative.)    
* **Support cross-governmental collaboration.** Double check you have the right people in the room. With technology like GenAI, your key stakeholders should be involved early and often. Your technology team is especially important \- they should get involved as soon as a project team decides they need to make a purchase. Security and legal experts, and someone who can represent the voice of whoever will use or be impacted by the technology, also need to be consulted along the way as you develop requirements and evaluate proposals. Usually the project team is responsible for pulling everyone together, but let them know if someone is missing.

## Your role as a Procurement Officer 

**Procurement officials are often helping drive the adoption strategy for how GenAI enters public service.** You help define the use case, your decisions shape how AI systems are evaluated and implemented and what safeguards and monitoring are put in place, and you help ensure oversight over vendors. You play a critical role in enabling teams to move quickly on promising opportunities, test solutions before major investments, scale successful implementations, and adjust direction based on learning. 

By focusing on organizational needs rather than technology hype, leveraging existing procurement best practices, and enabling agile implementation, procurement officers like you can help ensure AI investments deliver real value for their organizations and the public they serve. 

We recognize that many of you are doing your best despite challenging circumstances, and some of the practices we suggest in this guidance might feel wildly impossible given your context. Even so, we encourage you to review the material and think about what you can do, and check out our *Hacks for better GenAI procurement* section for ideas on how to get started.

You are also not alone. You do not need to know it all, or decide it all. Your project team and technology team are there to work alongside you. Here we break down what you have decision-making power around, and what you can influence: 

**As a procurement official, you have decision-making power around:**

* **The procurement method:** You can translate business requirements into effective purchasing strategies, and help experimental projects achieve better outcomes through flexible, iterative, agile approaches and pilots.   
* **Timeline:** Establishing procurement timelines and milestones that encourage strong vendor participation.    
* **Evaluation criteria:** For GenAI, criteria often go beyond price to include factors such as model algorithm and training data, risk mitigation, and much more.  
* **Contract terms and management:** For complex and evolving technology infrastructure like GenAI, proactive contract management is critical for monitoring performance, oversight, and ensuring the best outcomes. You can also help structure contracts to help enable scaling successful solutions. 

**You can also often influence:**  

* **Articulating the use case and what success looks like:** A strong use case grounded in real needs is critical for determining what type of solution your team should pursue. You can also help support ROI calculations, and define vendor performance metrics.   
* **Who is consulted as part of the procurement process, and when**. You can help pull in experts at the right moments.  
* **Requirements:** Your requirements should support the responsible use of GenAI, and encourage participation through balancing risk with what the market can realistically provide.   
* **AI Governance and risk assessments:** Your organization should have policies around AI governance and risk assessments in place around how AI is used, and how to address risks around transparency, privacy, and bias. You can help ensure that vendors comply with requirements through structuring appropriate contract terms and managing risk through procurement vehicles  
* **Understanding the market:** You can help evaluate vendor capabilities and market offerings, as well as discover new vendors.   
* **Vendor relationships:** Strong vendor outreach and engagement throughout the procurement cycle is critical for performance. You can also support contract modifications as needs evolve.   
* **How the GenAI is adopted and goes to scale:** You can facilitate contract expansion for successful solutions, enable cross-agency adoption where appropriate, and help manage ongoing vendor performance

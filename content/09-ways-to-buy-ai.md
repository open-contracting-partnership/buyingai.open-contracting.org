# Ways to *buy AI* 

```
Who: Procurement, project, and technology teams 
What: Description of AI use cases, aligned with type of AI feature, customization level, primary purchase type, commercial model (pricing and contract type), commercial risks, AI risks, and common procurement methods.
```

Governments often purchase AI through three pathways: **“Off-the-shelf”** for commercially available AI solutions for quick, common needs, **“Customize”** for proven AI systems to fit specific processes, or **“Build”** for new AI solutions for strategic, high-stakes, or emerging challenges. Your procurement pathway should be determined by **your use case**, and informed by other factors such as **risks.** 

Right now, off-the-shelf is the most common way we hear the public sector is buying AI, and this is increasingly happening through central purchasing. This trend implies a more limited role for procurement, both in terms of the purchasing process itself and supporting adoption. Custom or build solutions mean the public sector is purchasing software development services and time, rather than simply a product. This makes good technology procurement practices critical for success. 

Not all AI enters the public sector through these pathways. Sometimes AI isn’t deliberately purchased, but is **added on to existing services under contract** that the public sector is already using. Other times, AI is provided to public sector organizations through academic partnerships, grants, or pro bono pilots with private sector companies. 

Do you feel stuck? We’ve heard over and over again that teams don’t feel they have a choice when it comes to which pathway they pursue. If this is you, check out the **Hacks for better AI procurement** section for ideas on how to get the most out of your procurement if you can't choose the method.

## Use cases of procurement pathways

| Use case examples | Type of AI Feature | Customization Level | Primary Purchase Type | Commercial Model (Pricing & Contract Type) | Commercial Risks | Common procurement methods |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Off-the-shelf |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Commercially available solutions** *such as content creation, basic analytics, email assistance, and basic chatbot interactions)*  | Pre-built AI applications and tools | Off-the-shelf | Software license  | License fees, annual renewals, volume pricing | License management, upgrade costs | **Framework agreement/multiple awards or RFQ (under threshold), or** commercial purchase orders  |
| Customize |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ***Mature AI systems with known applications** (such as traffic flow optimization, document processing at scale, or permit processing)* | Enterprise-grade AI models with API integration | Minimal customization / off-the-shelf | Access to services, platforms or licenses  | Subscription fees, fixed license \+ support, integration contracts 	 | Integration and maintenance costs | **Open Tender:** Request for Tender (RFT) with requirements, or outcome-driven services RFP with defined performance goals |
| **Cloud-based AI platforms for enterprise digital transformation** (e.g., collaboration, knowledge management, analytics)  | Cloud-based AI services and platforms | Off-the-shelf | Platform subscription \+ minimal labor | Subscription/SaaS fees, usage-based billing | Subscription cost variations | **Multiple-awards schedule** or RFI/RFP with requirements |
| **Build** |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Strategic, complex AI solutions for newer use cases where outcomes matter** *(such as policy impact modelling, dynamic benefits optimization, or real-time emergency response systems)*  | ML models, custom architectures, specialized training | Highly custom/ purpose-built | Labor-intensive services \+ platform access; built for a very particular purpose which does not exist in existing models | Iterative/Milestone-based payments, time & materials | High development costs, uncertain ROI, vendor viability | **Outcome-driven services RFP/RFI** with defined performance goals |
| **Pilot AI solutions for emergent/experimental use cases** *(such as for smart infrastructure or predictive maintenance or public engagement platforms)* | Pre-trained models with custom fine-tuning capabilities  | Moderately customized/ fine-tuned | Labor-intensive services \+ platform access; built for a very particular purpose which does not exist in existing models | Time & materials, pilot funding, pay-as-you-go platform | Pilot overruns, scaling difficulties | **Innovation procurement:** Challenges, pilot funding |

```
Buying off-the-shelf is often pursued when…
Use case: Solutions are well-established and standardized
ROI: Clear ROI can be more easily demonstrated
Capacity: Internal technical resources are limited
Data security: No custom solution required to protect data beyond the organization’s standard privacy agreements. 
Timeline: Quick implementation is needed
Vendors: Established vendors exist, are pre-approved already and can deliver quickly

Buying customized or build AI is often pursued when…
Use case: Unique organizational needs exist
ROI: May be demonstrated or less certain for newer use cases
Capacity: Internal technical capability is strong
Data security: Custom solutions required 
Timeline: Sufficient time to accommodate agile development
Vendors: Pool of vendors with known capabilities, newer vendors and collaborations are needed

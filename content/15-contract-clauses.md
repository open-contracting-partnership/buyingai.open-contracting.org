# *Contract clauses*

```
- Who: Procurement teams
- What: Contract principles 
```

Your contract clauses will depend on your specific situation, use case, and needs, and if you are buying off-the-shelf, customized, or building AI. If you are buying an off-the-shelf solution, your team can conduct a gap analysis to understand to what extent the vendor’s standard license terms comply with your requirements. If you are buying something that is customized or build, then your team has the chance to put your requirements into the contract. 

Here, we provide an overview of some types of commercial and technical requirements to help jumpstart your thinking on what clauses to consider. These are not intended to be comprehensive lists, or serve as legal advice and should be complemented by your organization’s standard technology procurement clauses.

It’s also important to remember that contracts are just one aspect of managing risk. A good contract is short and clear, and should be [a tool for trust building and collaboration](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/11/02/bringing-policy-and-digital-together-to-deliver-contracts/), versus a long legal document all about transferring risk onto the other party. Even the most stringent contract is not a failsafe for managing risk. Be aware of what is feasible for vendors to agree to around issues like transparency and accuracy. Unrealistic expectations can lead to prolonged contract negotiations or failures.

# Building your procurement strategy

| Who: Procurement teams What: How to develop a procurement strategy, who to consult, and what to include |
| :---- |

A procurement strategy is a public-facing plan that explains how your state or local government will buy and deliver a specific technology to achieve measurable outcomes for residents and/or staff. 

A procurement strategy should articulate the problem you are trying to address and the outcomes you are seeking to achieve in plain language. It should also explain your chosen delivery approach (i.e. modular, agile etc.) your sourcing model (i.e. solicitation and contracts types, terms, timelines) and commercial terms up front. This helps set shared expectations for public agencies, vendors, oversight bodies, and the public and is particularly important when procuring mission-critical technology. 

Done well, a procurement strategy can help build alignment across stakeholders, determine the contract approach, support a strong vendor selection process, as well as set your organization up for good implementation. 

It’s valuable to start this process early, before preparing a solicitation. Where possible, a procurement strategy should include and/or be informed by RFIs and market research. Consulting the market can support you in better understanding what’s possible. Your procurement strategy should be a living document, and updated as new information becomes available during your procurement process. 

**Who to engage**   
Who you gather input from as you develop and refine your strategy is as important as the content itself. Key stakeholders include: 

* **Your internal experts**: You should speak to the agency or department buying the technology, and your technical and legal experts. Gathering this feedback early will help generate alignment around what you are buying, how you will buy it, and what to consider during implementation.    
* **Suppliers:** Strong, proactive supplier engagement is especially important for GenAI. GenAI technology and vendor capacity are changing very fast, so understanding what the market is capable of is important for many aspects of your procurement strategy. Potential engagement methods range from attending conferences or vendor fairs, to issuing RFIs (Request for Information), to innovative, challenge-based procurements.   
* **The public:** By engaging the public during the design of your procurement strategy, you can promote government transparency and accountability, and build trust with your residents. Public participation is especially important for any GenAI technology that the public might interact with directly as an end user, or used to influence government service delivery.

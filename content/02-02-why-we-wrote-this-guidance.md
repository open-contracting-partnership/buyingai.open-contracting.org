# Why we wrote this guidance

[Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/) is a nonprofit organization that supports public sector organizations around the world to get better results from their procurements through leveraging data, cross-sector collaboration, and goal-driven systems change. Given our technology expertise, our partners are now [asking us](https://www.open-contracting.org/2025/02/06/ocp-feedback-survey-closing-out-2024-and-whats-on-the-agenda-for-2025/) questions around buying AI and looking for more resources on how to get started.

We set out to create this guidance with and for procurement directors and officers, as well as for project teams from agencies or departments that want to buy and use AI technology. Through our one-on-one conversations and [group co-creation sessions](https://www.open-contracting.org/2025/07/10/what-public-procurement-officials-want-to-know-when-buying-genai/) with over fifty public practitioners and experts, we identified three critical challenges for successful AI procurement: 

1. Procurement teams want help understanding, in plain language, what to pay attention to when buying AI technology.   
2. Procurement, project, and IT/data teams seek to better collaborate and work in more agile ways to get the best products and outcomes.   
3. Public sector organizations must ready their IT, data, and project teams to adopt AI technology.

This guidance seeks to address these challenges by providing actionable and plain language information to help public sector procurement officials get started with the essential information they need to know when buying AI, as well as give procurement, project, and technology teams a shared language and vision for working together. We also highlight some of the key measures that leadership should take to help make their organizations ready to buy and adopt AI technology.

## Who this guidance is for

This guidance was created for **procurement officers**, who are accompanying the purchasing process and want to understand AI technology, how procuring AI is different, and what to pay attention to during the procurement process.

In addition, this guidance can also support: 

* **Project teams,** from departments or agencies who want to buy AI technology and are coordinating the overall process from needs identification through implementation, and who want to understand how to get the best results from their purchase.   
* **IT and data teams**, who are collaborating with procurement and project teams on AI procurements.   
* **Public sector leaders,** who oversee supporting organizational readiness for AI. 

## How to use this guidance

This guidance can help you no matter where you are on your AI procurement journey. For example, you may refer to this guidance when you’re: 

* Helping buy a technology solution with AI features  
* Developing your procurement strategy for a specific AI solution  
* Upskilling yourself on procuring AI

Each piece of content in this guidance is designed to stand alone. This means that you are welcome to review this guidance from top to bottom, or jump around. We assume that you are familiar with the procurement process and have some knowledge of [good IT procurement practices](https://www.open-contracting.org/2024/03/28/the-four-key-drivers-that-can-enable-better-it-procurement/). 

Several sections also feature key questions to ask, which are summarized in the **Key questions section** at the end of this guidance. You will note that these questions include both aspects for procurement and non-procurement staff to consider. This is because successful AI procurement is a team effort, and understanding generally what questions need to be asked, and when, can help you facilitate internal conversations and ensure that the right experts are involved in decision-making. 

This guidance is for consulting alongside your existing government policies, and frameworks. This is not legal advice.

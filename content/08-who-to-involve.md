# Who to involve

| Who: Procurement teams What: Key stakeholders in the GenAI procurement process  |
| :---- |

Complex technology like GenAI can require coordination and input across a range of stakeholders. All of these stakeholders should be involved as soon as you can, and often. Bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, skills, and experiences can help your organization reflect on the overall impact and consider requirements for security, privacy, explainability, audibility, and legal compliance.

It’s especially important to bring in your technology expert into your conversations as early as possible to help you understand if AI is a feasible and valuable tool to address your challenge, as well as navigate the technical components of the procurement and implementation processes.  

Precisely who you will involve will be different depending on your specific context. Your local laws, procurement system (centralized versus decentralized), and the specific purchase type will all impact your own final list of whom to engage.

**Key roles include:**

* **Procurement officer,** who leads the procurement process. They often have final signoff on the vendor selection process, and then provide oversight during contract implementation.   
* **Project team leader (buyer)**, or the agency/department representative that is seeking to make a purchase to meet a need. They usually facilitate the overall discovery process, ensuring smooth collaboration and progress. In a best-case scenario, this person is a product owner, who also has technology expertise.  
* **IT/Data science expert,** who can provide knowledgeable guidance around responsible AI use and its capacities and limitations, as well as infrastructure, security requirements, and more. They are usually in an advisory role, unless they are also in the position of being the buyer.   
* **Legal officer,**	who can help navigate considerations around data protection, liability, and intellectual property. They often provide sign-off on both the RFP and final contract.  

Another critical role is the **representative of the end user**. Although they are a different type of stakeholder, it’s still important to consult them and gather their feedback along the way. This engagement is especially important if the technology will impact the public or staff decision-making.

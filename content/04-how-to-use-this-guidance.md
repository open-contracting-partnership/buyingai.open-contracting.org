# *How to use* this guidance

This guidance can help you no matter where you are on your AI procurement journey. For example, you may refer to this guidance when you’re: 

* Helping buy a technology solution with AI features  
* Developing your procurement strategy for a specific AI solution  
* Upskilling yourself on procuring AI

Each piece of content in this guidance is designed to stand alone. This means that you are welcome to review this guidance from top to bottom, or jump around. We assume that you are familiar with the procurement process and have some knowledge of [good IT procurement practices](https://www.open-contracting.org/2024/03/28/the-four-key-drivers-that-can-enable-better-it-procurement/). 

Several sections also feature key questions to ask, which are summarized in the [**Key questions section**](https://buyingai.open-contracting.org/chapter/17-key-questions-to-ask#content) at the end of this guidance. You will note that these questions include both aspects for procurement and non-procurement staff to consider. This is because successful AI procurement is a team effort, and understanding generally what questions need to be asked, and when, can help you facilitate internal conversations and ensure that the right experts are involved in decision-making. 

This guidance is for consulting alongside your existing government policies, and frameworks. This is not legal advice.

## Ways to buy GenAI

Governments often purchase GenAI through three pathways: 

* **Off-the-shelf** for commercially available AI tools. Use cases include content creation, basic analytics, email assistance, and basic chatbot interactions. Examples include Claude (Anthropic), Microsoft CoPilot, or Google Workspace AI.   
* **Customize** for mature AI systems with known applications. Use cases include traffic flow optimization, document processing at scale, or permit processing, or cloud-based AI platforms for enterprise digital transformation, like knowledge management and analytics. Examples include custom Microsoft Copilot Studio agents, or customized CRM solutions through Salesforce Government Cloud with Einstein AI, or customized AI solutions through AWS GovCloud AI Services.   
* **Build** for strategic, complex AI solutions for newer use cases. Use cases include policy impact modelling, dynamic benefits optimization, or real-time emergency response systems, or for pilot AI solutions for emergent/experimental use cases, like smart infrastructure or predictive maintenance or public engagement platforms. Examples include the U.S. Internal Revenue Service’s custom-built AI tool for fraud detection. 

As you consider what pathway to choose, it can be helpful to consider several factors: 

| Factors  | Then consider…. | Procurement method  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Use case:** Solutions are well-established and standardized **ROI:** Clear ROI can be demonstrated **Capacity:** Internal technical resources are limited **Data security:** No custom solution required to protect data beyond the company’s standard privacy agreements.  **Timeline:** Quick implementation is needed **Vendors**: Established vendors exist, are pre-approved already and can deliver fast | → | Off-the-shelf procurement  |
| **Use case:** Unique organizational needs exist **ROI:** May be less certain for newer use cases **Capacity:** Internal technical capability is strong **Data security:** Custom solutions required  **Timeline:** Sufficient time to accommodate agile development **Vendors:**  Pool of vendors with known capabilities, newer vendors and collaborations are needed | → | Customize or build procurement |

| Use case examples | Type of GenAI Feature | Customization Level | Primary Purchase Type | Commercial Model (Pricing & Contract Type) | Commercial Risks | GenAI Risks | Common procurement methods |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Off-the-shelf |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Commercially available tools over/under threshold** *(such as content creation, basic analytics, email assistance, and basic chatbot interactions)*  | Pre-built AI applications and tools | Off-the-shelf | Software license (tool) | License fees, annual renewals, volume pricing | License management, upgrade costs | Limited customization, potential misuse, vendor dependence | **Framework agreement/multiple awards or RFQ (under threshold)**  |
| Customize |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ***Mature AI systems with known applications** (such as traffic flow optimization, document processing at scale, or permit processing)* | Enterprise-grade AI models with API integration | Minimal customization / off-the-shelf | Access to services, platforms or licenses  | Subscription fees, fixed license \+ support, integration contracts 	 | Integration and maintenance costs | Model drift, security vulnerabilities, dependency risks | **Open Tender:** Request for Tender (RFT) with requirements  |
| **Cloud-based AI platforms for enterprise digital transformation** (e.g., collaboration, knowledge management, analytics)  | Cloud-based AI services and platforms | Off-the-shelf | Platform subscription \+ minimal labor | Subscription/SaaS fees, usage-based billing | Subscription cost variations | Data privacy, compliance risks, API availability | **Multiple-awards schedule** or RFI/RFP with requirements |
| **Build** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Strategic, complex AI solutions for newer use cases where outcomes matter** *(such as policy impact modelling, dynamic benefits optimization, or real-time emergency response systems)*  | ML models, custom architectures, specialized training | Highly custom / purpose-built | Labor-intensive services \+ platform access; built for a very particular purpose which does not exist in existing models | Milestone-based payments, time & materials | High development costs, uncertain ROI, vendor viability | Model bias, data quality issues, explainability challenges, novel failure modes | **Outcome-driven RFP/RFI** with defined performance goals |
| **Pilot AI solutions for emergent/experimental use cases** *(such as for smart infrastructure or predictive maintenance or public engagement platforms)* | Pre-trained models with custom fine-tuning capabilities  | Moderately customized / fine-tuned | Labor-intensive services \+ platform access; built for a very particular purpose which does not exist in existing models | Time & materials, pilot funding, pay-as-you-go platform | Pilot overruns, scaling difficulties | Limited test data, integration challenges, performance inconsistency | **Innovation procurement:** Challenges, pilot funding |

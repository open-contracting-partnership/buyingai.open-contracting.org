# Introduction

It’s become impossible to escape the hype around GenAI technology. Government leaders hope to leverage GenAI to increase efficiency, helping stretch tight human resources to better serve the public. Meanwhile, concerned advocates fear that GenAI could worsen government services by outsourcing decisions to opaque, hallucinating algorithms. Some companies are adding GenAI features to their products \- regardless of if GenAI is asked for, or if it's actually GenAI to begin with.      

Procurement is the moment where GenAI hype meets reality. Done well, the procurement process can help government secure the best solution to meet its needs while mitigating risks, and deliver on policy goals to improve lives. Done poorly, the procured GenAI tools might be underused at best, or misused at worst, resulting in expensive failures that weaken trust in government.  

To make the most of GenAI technology, everyone involved in the procurement process must be more nimble and collaborative than ever before. GenAI requires specific considerations to manage unique risks and opportunities. Leadership must step up to create AI governance policies and support agile tech procurement practices. Procurement officers need some basic understanding of how AI works, what they should pay special attention to, and who to involve. Project and technology teams need to understand how the procurement process works, and what to consider as they collaborate together with procurement. Everyone needs to be aware of what questions to ask, and when.

**Why we wrote this guidance**

[Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/) is a nonprofit that supports governments around the world to get better results from their procurements through leveraging data, cross-sector collaboration, and goal-driven systems change. Given our technology expertise, our partners are now [coming to us](https://www.open-contracting.org/2025/02/06/ocp-feedback-survey-closing-out-2024-and-whats-on-the-agenda-for-2025/) with questions around buying GenAI and looking for more resources on how to get started.

We set out to create this guidance with and for procurement directors and officers, as well as project teams from agencies or departments that want to buy and use GenAI technology. Through our one-on-one conversations and [group co-creation sessions](https://www.open-contracting.org/2025/07/10/what-public-procurement-officials-want-to-know-when-buying-genai/), we identified three critical challenges for successful GenAI procurement: 

* Procurement teams want help understanding, in plain language, what to pay attention to when buying GenAI technology.     
* Procurement, project, and technology teams seek to better collaborate and work in more agile ways to get the best products and outcomes.     
* Organizations can do more to be ready to adopt GenAI technology.

This guidance seeks to address these challenges by providing actionable and plain language guidance to help procurement officials get started with the essential information they need to know when buying GenAI, as well as give procurement, project, and technology teams a shared language and vision for working together. We also highlight some of the key measures that leadership should take to help make their organizations ready to buy and adopt GenAI technology.

**Who this guidance is for**

This guidance was created for **procurement officers**, who are accompanying the purchasing process and want to understand GenAI technology, how procuring GenAI is different, and what you should pay attention to during the procurement process.

In addition, this guidance can also support:  

* **Project teams,** from departments or agencies who want to buy GenAI technology and are coordinating the overall process from need identification through implementation, and who want to understand how to get the best results from their purchase.   
* **Technology teams**, who are collaborating with procurement and project teams on GenAI procurements.   
* **Government leaders,** who are in charge of supporting organizational readiness for AI. 

**How to use this guidance**

This guidance can help you no matter where you are on your GenAI procurement journey. For example, you may refer to this guidance when you’re: 

* Helping buy a technology tool with GenAI features  
* Developing your procurement strategy for a specific GenAI tool  
* Upskilling yourself on procuring GenAI
